            <hr>
            <p id="step-1">
                Remove the honey from the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450Â°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut the potatoes crosswise into 1/2-inch rounds. Grate the fontina cheese on the large side of a box grater. Peel and medium dice the shallot. If necessary, peel 1 clove of garlic. Finely chop the clove; using the flat side of your knife, smash until it resembles a paste (or use a zester). Halve the buns. Roughly chop the tomatoes; place in a bowl and top with half the vinegar. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; stir to combine. In a bowl, combine the honey (kneading the packet before opening) and mustard. Season with salt and pepper.

            <p id="step-2">
                Place the potato rounds on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 17 to 19 minutes, or until lightly browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Leaving the oven on, remove from the oven. Carefully top with the grated fontina cheese. Return to the oven and roast 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Remove from the oven.

            <p id="step-3">
                While the potatoes roast, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the diced shallot; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned and softened. Transfer to a large bowl. Wipe out the pan.

            <p id="step-4">
                While the potatoes continue to roast, to the bowl of cooked shallot, add the beef; season with salt and pepper. Gently mix to combine. Using your hands, form the mixture into two 1/2-inch-thick patties. Transfer to a plate. In the same pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the patties and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a plate. Carefully drain off and discard any excess oil.

                Add the buns, cut side down, to the pan of reserved fond (if the pan seems dry, add a drizzle of olive oil). Toast on medium-high, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until browned. Assemble the burgers using the toasted buns, goat cheese spread, cooked patties, and seasoned tomatoes. Serve with the finished potatoes. Drizzle the potatoes with the honey mustard. Enjoy!
